Next import the package by dragging the .unitypackage you downloaded into your "Project" Window at the bottom of your screen (Make sure you drag into the empty space)
Follow the steps on the getting started window that opens up to get you on your feet.
# Tags
Tags help to identify which object has different properties. we cant add our own tags, as they aren't implemented in the game.
below is the current updated list of all tags and their functionality:
* GameController - Low Gravity Zone
* Finish - Respawn Trigger
* Respawn - Spawnpoint
